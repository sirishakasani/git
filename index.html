    <p>This policy grants the "s3:GetObject" action to anyone ("Principal": "*"), allowing them to read (download) objects from the specified S3 bucket ("Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*").

Remember that making objects publicly readable means anyone with the object's URL can access it. Make sure this aligns with your security requirements and compliance standards.
